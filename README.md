# Matrixlib

I made this project to learn how to use templates, operator overloading and other overloadings in C++. This project is a library for matrix operations in C++. I'm glad that years after implementing it, this project was really useful in a bigger [project of computer graphics](https://github.com/fvvsantana/OpenGLProjects).

The learned concepts in this project were:

* Overloading of constructors, destructors, typecast and assign operators.

* Implementation of the +, -, /, \*, [], << and maybe more operators.

* Use of templates to make generic functions that accepts flexible data types (int, double, float, etc.).

* How to create namespaces.

* CMake and Makefile.
